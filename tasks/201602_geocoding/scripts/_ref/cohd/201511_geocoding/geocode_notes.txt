Geocoding project reference:
see:
resistome (rise)


To Do:
1) address the zip's that end up having two boro's, ie. Marble Hill. 
2) Copy BIN (building points) XY stuff
3) 


Completed: 
1) Strip/split APT
1) ZIP codes as only 5 digits, get rid of 4 digit extension
1) Remove, collapse duplicates, get total N
- maybe try collapsing by concating all the address vars into one col, then groupby, then split by comma [0]
- then assign unique address id - uaid.
